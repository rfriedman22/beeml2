The demo data in this directory is derived from [Friedman et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2024.12.004). You can obtain the data from [this repo](https://github.com/barakcohenlab/CRX-Active-Learning). The motifs come from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barakcohenlab/CRX-Active-Learning/c2f8b4b600de209194b66303df4acd8444acab34/Data/Downloaded/eLifeMotifs.meme) and the sequences are in [this directory](https://github.com/barakcohenlab/CRX-Active-Learning/tree/main/Data/Sequences/Fasta) based on the two pairs used in analyses [here](https://github.com/barakcohenlab/CRX-Active-Learning/blob/main/enhancer_mutagenesis.ipynb) and [here](https://github.com/barakcohenlab/CRX-Active-Learning/blob/main/enhancer_mutagenesis.ipynb).
